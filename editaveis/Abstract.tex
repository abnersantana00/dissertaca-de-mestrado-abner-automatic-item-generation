Developing programming skills in introductory courses demands frequent exercises and assessments, yet writing large numbers of questions by hand is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This work proposes automating question creation with multilayer templates. Guided by a cognitive model, the instructor structures each template as hierarchical layers of fixed and variable parts. A generative AI assistant supports two key processes: (1) suggesting scenarios and variation points to accelerate authoring, and (2) analyzing students’ submitted code to provide immediate corrective feedback. Although building the initial templates requires notable effort, their reuse streamlines large-scale exercise production. Preliminary results show that instructors prefer adapting ready-made templates because of the time saved. Future work should expand the template repository, further integrate generative AI, and deliver a graphical interface that simplifies large-scale authoring and deployment.
