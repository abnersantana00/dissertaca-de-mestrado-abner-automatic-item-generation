Developing programming skills in introductory courses requires frequent practice exercises, yet manually crafting questions is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this challenge, this study investigates automatic question generation through multilayer templates supported by generative artificial intelligence, which suggests variations and provides feedback to students. A web-based tool was created that employs JSON files to define hierarchical templates and their question instances. A mixed-methods research design was adopted, including a case study with eight instructors to evaluate template-construction time, the number of questions generated, and perceptions gathered via questionnaires. Most instructors produced a complete template within 30 minutes, although they preferred adapting pre-existing models. The primary difficulties reported were the steep learning curve, direct JSON manipulation, and the absence of a graphical interface for visualizing layers. Future work involves expanding the template repository, developing a visual editor, and evaluating the solution with larger samples.
